Static Methods , Static Fields :- 
- static keyword can be applied not only to methods but also to variables of the class. 
- Sometimes a method performs a task that does not depend on an object. We can execute the task without 
instantiating the object of the class. 
- Non-static methods are typically called instance methods.
- static methods does not depend on the state of the object. Its independent and only depends on the arguments passed to it.
- A static method can call other static methods of the same class directly and can manipulate static variables in the same
class directly.
- To access the class's instance variables and instance methods, a static method must use a reference to an object of the class.
- To declare a method as static , place the keyword static before the return type in the methods declaration.
- calling a static method : ClassName.methodName(arguments)
Ex : MathClass methods 
- class Math provides a collection of static methods that enable you to perform common mathematical calculations.
- A static method is also called a class method. Similarly a static variable is also called a class variable.


- Recall that each object of a class maintains its own copy of every instance variable of the class. 
- There are variables for which each object of a class does not need its own seperate copy. Such variables are
declared static and are also known as class variables.
- When objects of a class containing static variables are created, all the objects of that class share one copy
of those variables.
- Together a class's static variables and instance variables are known as its fields.

- public keyword allows you to use these fields in your own class.
- A field declared with keyword final is constant - its value cannot change after the field is initialized.


Why is method main declared as static ??
- The JVM attempts to invoke the main method of the class you specify. At this point no objects of the class 
have been created. 
- Declaring main as static allows the JVM to invoke main without creating an instance of a class.


3 methods to call a method
a) Using a method name by itself to call another method of the same class. 
b) Using a variable that contains a reference to an object followed by a dot (.) and the method name to call a 
method of referenced object.
c) Using the class name and the dot(.) to call a static method of a class.


Scope of Declarations
- Declarations introduce names that can be used to refer to such java entities.
- The scope of a declaration is the portion of the program that can refer to the declared entity by its name.
Such an entity is said to be "in scope" for that portion of the program.
- if a local variable or parameter in a method has the same name as a field of the class , the field is hidden
until the block in which the local variable was declared terminates. This is called Shadowing. !!
