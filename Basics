/*we have 2 types of variables in java  primitive and reference data types.

primitive variables :boolean,byte,short,int,long,float,double,char
reference variables : String 
Primitive data types are only 8 types as mentioned above. Reference data types are unlimited since they are 
user defined.Primitive data types stores data but reference data types stores an address.Primitive data 
types could hold only 1 value,they use less memory and are faster.On the other hand,reference data types 
could hold more than 1 value,use more memory and and are slower to access.*/
