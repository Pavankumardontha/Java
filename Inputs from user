The problem is with the input.nextInt() method - it only reads the int value. So when you continue reading with input.nextLine() you receive the "\n" Enter key. 
So to skip this you have to add the input.nextLine().
if the scanner is looking for an integer and if we input a string then there would be inputmismatchexception. In future we use exception 
handling to prevent this from happening.*/
